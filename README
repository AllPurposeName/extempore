Extempore:

Extempore is a new live-coding environment which borrows a core
foundation from the Impromptu environment
(http://impromptu.moso.com.au).  Extempore is named as a nod to the
Impromptu project from which it was seeded.

At this stage in the project Extempore exists as a "developers" seed
project.  It is in a useable state but is not regarded as stable for
end-users.  Binaries will be made available when the project reaches a
more user friendly state.


Building:

See the INSTALL notes for build instructions.


Current Status:

Extempore is currently in a functional although unstable state. There
are known stability issues that will be resolved but are not currently
considered a high priority. In practice this means that Extempore is
useable for personal projects but should not currently be used for
live, or public performance.

Extempore's support for 3rd party libraries is fully dynamic. This
means that Extempore binds to dynamic libraries at runtime.  There are
a number of example libraries which can be found in the libs
directory.  Many (although not all) of these libraries require you to
install a 3rd party library (.so for linux .dylib for OSX, dll for
Windows).  In particular there is an 'example' DSP library and a
library binding Extempore to the Horde3D game engine.

Although Extempore is immature it is worth mentioning that it is
already being used to develop some substantial audiovisual software.



Open Source - Open Platform:

Extempore currently builds on OSX, Linux and Windows 7 platforms.

The project is released under a BSD style licence.


Community:

Please jump on in - there is loads to do - even if you're not a C/C++
developer!

I have started a google group called "Extempore"
http://groups.google.com/group/extemporelang.  Joining this group is
probably your best first step in getting involved.
