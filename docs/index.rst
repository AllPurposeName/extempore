   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

The Extempore programming environment
=====================================

Welcome to Extempore's documentation site. It's a work in
progress---up till now things have been hosted on `Ben's blog
<http://benswift.me/extempore-docs/>`_ but this is an attempt to do
things right, using `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_.

These docs are generated from the reStructured text (``.rst``) files
in the ``docs/`` subdirectory in the Extempore source distribution. So
if you find problems, or can think of improvements, fork away on GH,
edit the doc source files and submit a pull request---we'd love these
docs to become a real community effort.
