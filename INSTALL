Extempore has some library dependencies. 

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; on linux and OSX
LLVM
pthread
pcre (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions)
glfw (a light weight opengl lib)
glut

;; on linux you will also need
portaudio
mesa GL (opengl)

;; on osx you also need the following frameworks
opengl
coreaudio
cocoa

Most of these are pretty standard and you will probably already have them on your system (or they will be easy to install).  The three that you are most likely to need to download, compile and install yourself are PCRE, GLFW and LLVM.  You can find them here:

PCRE you can get from:
http://www.pcre.org/

GLFW you can get from:
http://www.glfw.org/

LLVM you can get from:
http://www.llvm.org/

In all cases building from the most recent source should "just work".  Also all three should build fine with standard defaults.  So a simple configure/make should be sufficient in all cases.

PCRE and GLFW should be installed in the usual locations (i.e. somewhere that gcc can find).

LLVM is a special case and currently has it's own  argument for the extempore build script which should just point directly to the top level LLVM source directory.

Once all of the library dependencies for you platform are installed you can build extempore using the build.sh script.  It currently takes two arguments, the first tells whether to build for "osx" or "linux" and the second points to the top level llvm directory.

So to build on osx for example you would do something like this

bash-3.2$ . ./build.sh osx /Users/andrew/Documents/Code/llvm-2.8
compiling for osx ...
done
bash-3.2$ 

voila ... you should be done.

To run extempore you need to pass a single argument - the path to the runtime directory.

for example:

bash-3.2$ ./extempore `pwd`/runtime

Once you've started extempore you can connect using either telnet or emacs (using the included extras/extempore.el file)

If using telnet the default extempore port to connect to is 7099. Additionally extempore currently takes a second argument (1 for true) which provides some additional banner information which can be useful for a telnet session.


If you want to use emacs you'll need to add the following to your .emacs file.
(autoload 'extempore-mode "/path/to/extempore.el" "" t)
extempore.el can be found in the extras directory.
