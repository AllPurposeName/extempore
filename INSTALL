Installation Instructions
=========================

Prerequisites
=============

Extempore has some library dependencies. 

On linux and OSX:
   - LLVM (version 2.8, 2.9 or 3.0)
   - pthread (if not using boost)
     OR boost (if not using pthread)
   - pcre (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions)

On linux you will also need:
   - portaudio
   - mesa GL (opengl)
   - (optionally jack)

On OSX you also need the following frameworks:
   - opengl
   - coreaudio
   - cocoa

On Windows 7
   - LLVM (version 2.8, 2.9 or 3.0)
   - pcre
   - boost
   - portaudio

Most of these  are pretty standard and you  will probably already have
them on your system (or they will be easy to install).  The three that
you are most likely to  need to download, compile and install yourself
are PCRE, PORTAUDIO and LLVM.  You can find them here:

   PCRE you can get from:
   http://www.pcre.org/

   PORTAUDIO you can get from:
   http://www.portaudio.com

   LLVM you can get from:
   http://www.llvm.org/

PCRE and PortAudio should build from the most recent source and should
"just work".  LLVM must be version 2.8,2.9,3.0.  All three should
build fine with standard defaults - although you do need to provide an
install location for LLVM.  So a simple './configure', then 'make' and
then 'make install' should be sufficient for PCRE and PORTAUDIO. LLVM
will require an additional build location, so something like
'./configure --prefix=~/Documents/ext_llvm' then 'make -j2' and then
'make install'.

PCRE and PortAudio should be installed in the usual locations
(i.e. somewhere that gcc can find).  LLVM is a special case.  You'll
need to do ONE of either (a) copy config/llvm.bash.sample to
config/llvm.bash and edit it according to the prefix install location
you set for LLVM.  OR (b) set the EXT_LLVM_DIR shell variable to point
to the prefix install location for LLVM.  Make sure you download
version 2.8, 2.9 or 3.0 of LLVM!  (i.e. $ export
EXT_LLVM_DIR=~/Documents/ext_llvm)

Once all of the library dependencies for your platform are installed,
you can build extempore using:

   ./all.bash

Voila ... you should be done.

There are a couple of extra build arguments that you may need to use

1) If you are building against LLVM version 3.0+ you to define
EXT_LLVM_3.  

2) If you wish to build against the boost library you
need to define EXT_BOOST.

So to build against LLVM 3.0+ with boost support you would use the
build command:

   ./all.bash -DEXT_LLVM_3 -DEXT_BOOST



Ubuntu GNU/Linux Installation
=============================

You'll need some dependencies:

   $ sudo apt-get install libpthread-stubs0 libpcre3 libpcre3-dev libglfw2 
     libglfw-dev glutg3 libglut3 libglut3-dev portaudio19-dev

If you want to build against the boost libraries you'll also need:
   $ sudo apt-get install libboost-dev 

For now you need to build LLVM from source (it will take some time):

   $ wget http://llvm.org/releases/2.8/llvm-2.8.tgz
   $ tar -xvzf llvm-2.8.tgz
   $ cd llvm-2.8/
   $ ./configure --prefix=~/Documents/ext_llvm
   $ make
   $ make install

Now you can build Extempore:

   $ git clone https://github.com/digego/extempore.git
   $ cd extempore/
   $ export EXT_LLVM_DIR=~/Documents/ext_llvm
   $ ./all.bash

OR with LLVM 3.0 and Boost and JACK

   $ ./all.bash -DEXT_LLVM_3 -DEXT_BOOST -DJACK_AUDIO

NOTE1: If you want to compile against Jack instead of portaudio
       provide all.bash with a -DJACK_AUDIO argument (and make sure
       that the jack libs and headers are installed correctly!)




WINDOWS 
=========== 
Windows support is new but functional. Boost is mandatory for Extempore
on WindowYou will need to build BOOST, 
PORTAUDIO and LLVM 3.0+ for yourself.  These can all be built as static
libs.  Unfortunately there is currently no build process supported so 
you're on your own.  I have an MSVS 2010 project for extempore that 
can get you started if you send me an email.

Below are a few notes that may help to get you on the right track.

Some Early Windows Build Notes (for me so I don't forget)
=========================================================
(a) Make sure you install CMake
(b) Use CMake to Build LLVM (choose 64bit option)
(c) Make sure portaudio msvc general project settings are set to static lib
(d) boost command line for bjam is:
:> bjam --build-dir=<dir> toodset=msvc link=static address-model=64 --build-type=complete stage
(e) extempore msvs project settings needs "PCRE_STATIC" to be defined if you want to build against pcre static libs
(f) extmepore msvs project needs EXT_BOOST and EXT_LLVM_3 to both be defined
(g) pcreposix.lib needs to come before pcre.lib in link list
      


Running
=======

To run extempore you need to pass  a single argument - the path to the
runtime directory.

For example:

   $ ./extempore runtime

Once you've started extempore you can connect using either Telnet,
Emacs (using the included extras/extempore.el file), or vim (using
the included extras/extempore.vim).

If  using  Telnet  the  default   extempore  port  to  connect  to  is
7099. Additionally extempore currently  takes a second argument (1 for
true) which  provides some additional banner information  which can be
useful for a Telnet session.

If you  want to  use Emacs you'll  need to  add the following  to your
~/.emacs file:

   (autoload 'extempore-mode "/path/to/extempore.el" "" t)

extempore.el can be found in the extras directory.

If you want to use (g)Vim, see the instructions found in "extras/extempore.vim".
