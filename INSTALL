Extempore currently a few external libs.  3 in particular are unlikely to be allready available on your system.  PCRE, LLVM and GLFW.  You will need to download and build these.

PCRE you can get from:
http://www.pcre.org/

GLFW you can get from:
http://www.glfw.org/

LLVM you can get from:
http://www.llvm.org/

In all cases building from the most recent source should "just work".  Also all three should build fine with standard defaults.  So a simple configure/make should work in all cases.

PCRE and GLFW should be installed in the usual locations (i.e. somewhere that gcc can find).

LLVM is a special case and currently has it's own  argument for the extempore build script which should just point directly to the top level LLVM source directory.

Once these three libraries are built/installed you can build extempore using the build.sh script.  It currently takes two arguments, the first tells whether to build for "osx" or "linux" and the second points to the top level llvm directory.

So to build on osx for example you would do something like this

bash-3.2$ . ./build.sh osx /Users/andrew/Documents/Code/llvm-2.8
compiling for osx ...
done
bash-3.2$ 

voila ... you should be done.

To run extempore you need to pass a single argument - the path to the runtime directory.

for example:

bash-3.2$ ./extempore `pwd`/runtime

Once you've started extempore you can connect using either telnet or emacs (using the included extras/extepore.el file)

If using telnet the default extempore port to connect to is 7099
